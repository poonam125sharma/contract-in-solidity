# contract-in-solidity
It's a very basic Voting Contract where one can Vote for either React or Angular what they likes, when deployed, one can cast vote and get the total votes for both the choices.
It was coded in the Browser Solidity IDE Remix (https://remix.ethereum.org) and deployed and tested.
